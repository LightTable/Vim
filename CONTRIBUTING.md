## Help

For questions and community discussion, please drop them in the [Light Table Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/light-table-discussion).

## Bugs

When filing a bug on GitHub, please help us help you with the following:

* Confirm that the bug also occurs on CodeMirror's [vim demo](http://codemirror.net/demo/vim.html). If it does, then the bug should be reported to [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues) instead of with us.
* Mention your operating system, LT and plugin versions.
* Steps to reproduce the bug.

Note: The issue tracker is for bugs, not general help. Questions should be asked on the [Light Table Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/light-table-discussion) instead.

## Pull requests

Our vim implementation (vim.js) comes directly from CodeMirror. Please do not send pull requests modifying it. Instead, send a pull request [to CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror). Once they release a new version of vim.js, we can upgrade it on this plugin. Thanks!
